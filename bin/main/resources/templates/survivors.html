							protector grew and he soon became a sort of "babysitter" for a
							group of kids in Hawkins with a knack for messing around with
							strange and dangerous things. His courage is unmatched so that he
							was even able to fend off a Demogorgon when it threatened his
							friends. One evening he received a call for assistance from his
							friend Nancy Wheeler. He drove all the way to the Hawkins
							National Laboratory to see if she was okay. He searched the area
							but only found her notebook. Before he realised what was
							happening the ground opened up and a swirl of black mist filled
							his eyes. When he awakened he was in a strange place that seemed
							familiar but unfamiliar at the same time. </i>
