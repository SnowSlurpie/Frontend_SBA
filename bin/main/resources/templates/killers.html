					face, large, curved, razor-sharp claws, and powerful legs to pounce
					on victims, make The Demogorgon a frightening monster to face in
					any dimension. It is a nightmare of unrestrained, feral rage as it
					hunts down its prey and rips it to pieces, devouring every last
					morsel of flesh and gore, leaving nothing for scavengers. The
					creature is untouched by any sense of compassion or restraint.
					Looming over its victim, it shows no doubt or mercy, just the pure
					instinct of its insatiable blood lust as it delivers the deathblow.
					A perfect hunter, The Demogorgon is a macabre testament to the
					horrors lurking in the Upside Down and why it was choice pickings
					for The Entity. </i></td>

				<p style="color: white">Some humans are simply bad seeds. Seeds infused with a

				<p>Michael Myers is one of those seeds. He had no issues with
					causing the pain of others. Instead, it was exactly what he sought.
					But even life can be tough on those with minds filled with terror.
					The difference is just how one goes about to solve those problems.
					For Michael, he had to kill to find some inner peace. As he took
					his sisters life, the police found a silent boy dressed as a clown
					at the scene.</p>

				<p>
					When one stumbles upon a growing fire, one does not pour gasoline
					on it.<br> But this was an action taken by officials that had
					no idea how it would shape this demon in the boy's body.<br>
					Sending Michael to a mental institution was a feeble attempt to
					save the child.<br> Unsuccessful therapy and nightly screams
					just made him even more introverted and deranged.
				</p>

				<p>People hoped that Michael Myers would end up a parenthesis,
					soon to be forgotten and buried, a failure that soon were to rot
					away. But then...he escaped.</p>
